       Data structures are essential components that help organize and store data efficiently in computer memory. <BR>
       They provide a way to manage and manipulate data effectively, enabling faster access, insertion, and deletion operations.<BR>
       Common data structures include arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, and graphs , each serving specific purposes based <BR>
       on the requirements of the problem at hand. Understanding data structures is fundamental for designing efficient algorithms and<BR>
       optimizing software performance.<BR>

     <H4>DATA STRUCTURE IMPORTANTS</H4>
     
      Data structures are an important component of computer science since they help professionals store<BR>
 and manage large datasets. Using an effective system can help you retrieve information easily. Employers often<BR> 
ask individuals about data structures in computer science interviews to showcase their knowledge <BR>
of the fundamental starting point for programming. <BR>
It's also helpful for other related sectors, such as artificial intelligence (AI), graphics and operating systems.<BR>
    <H5>THE IMPORTANCE OF TYPE OD DATA STRUCTURE </H5>
     There are a variety of data structures that computer programmers can use depending on the task they are completing
 or the application they're using. Here are nine common types of data structures you can use in software engineering:
1. Arrays
Arrays store similar items together. This structure uses contiguous memory allocation to organize data. Those using an
 array identify each element with at least one array index or key. An array serves as the foundation for other data structures, 
such as hash tables and lists. Computer scientists often use this structure when sorting algorithms.
2. Stacks
Stacks use a last in, first out (LIFO) structure where the computer orders previous work with the last action appearing first. 
For instance, if you enter the dataset, "1, 2, 3, 4," the last digit, "4," would appear at the top. This type of data structure 
creates a pile or stack of information. A stack data structure is helpful when organizing information where the order of actions
 is important. The design of this structure helps you make sure you complete your task before moving on to a new one.

3. Queues
Contrary to stacks, queues follow a first in, first out (FIFO) structure for organizing data. This linear structure resembles a queue<BR>
 for waiting since information goes in and waits to be outputted. The information entered first is the first to leave the line.
 Computer programmers use queues to organize data that doesn't need to be processed immediately.
4. Linked lists
Linked lists organize items, or nodes, in linear order based on those related to each other. Each node consists of the data and a pointer. <BR>
The data is what the programmer assigned to the node, and the pointer is a reference to the next node in the series. Linked lists work well<BR>
 for situations where you need to be able to delete data. They also can also help implement stacks and queues.

5. Binary trees
A binary tree is a non-linear structure that consists of nodes with two potential values or directions. The top node, or root, contains a <BR>
right child and a left child. The different types of binary trees include:<BR>
Rooted binary tree: Rooted binary trees have a root node, with every node having up to two children.
Full binary tree: This type of binary tree occurs when every node has either zero or two children.
Perfect binary tree: In a perfect binary tree, all interior nodes contain two children, and all external nodes, or leaves, have the same level.<BR>
Complete binary tree: Complete binary trees occur when all levels except for the last are completely filled and nodes are located as far left as possible.<BR>
Balanced binary tree: Balanced binary trees are ones where the left and right children's heights are different by at least one, the left child <BR>
has a balanced amount and the right child has a balanced amount.<BR>
Degenerate tree: In a degenerate tree, each parent node only has one child, representing a linked list.<BR>
Binary trees are helpful when reflecting structural relationships in data. They can also help represent hierarchies.<BR>

6. Graphs
Graphs are a type of nonlinear list used to represent a network. They consist of nodes and edges that connect to one another. <BR>
These structures use a pair, X and Y, with the X vertex connecting the Y vertex. Graphs are useful when studying a network, <BR>
such as a path in a city or a social media network.<BR>

7. Tries
Tries, or "prefix trees" are tree-like data structures used to store data. They are often used to represent words of the alphabet. <BR>
Nodes of the tree are strings programmers can retrieve by going down the branch. Tries are useful for organizing data dependent on a
 prefix of a string. A common use for tries is providing auto-suggestions and looking up words in a dictionary.<BR>

8. Hash tables
Hash tables, or maps, store key-value pairs. They compute an index, or hash code, into slots where the desired value is located. <BR>
Computer programmers store information in an array manner. They can use hash tables to implement associate arrays, database indexes <BR>
and the set data structure.

9. Skip lists
Skip lists are probabilistic data structures that list elements with a linked list. This type of structure is called a skip list because<BR>
 it skips several elements of an entire list. Each additional level in a skip list contains fewer elements, with no new elements. <BR>
Skip lists are helpful for instances when programmers want to remove, insert and search for information quickly.<BR>
