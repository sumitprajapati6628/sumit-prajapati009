Microsoft 365/Microsoft Office 2021 is the most effective, reliable, and easiest to use of all the suites, but it has two disadvantages: First,
 it's expensive. Second, you may have strong reasons to avoid proprietary software. If you insist on open-source software, then LibreOffice is your
 only serious choice.
