      Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language that is designed <BR>
        to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. It is a general-purpose programming language<BR>
        intended to let programmers write once, run anywhere (WORA),[16] meaning that compiled Java code<BR>
        can run on all platforms that support Java without the need to recompile.[17] Java applications are<BR>
        typically compiled to bytecode that can run on any Java virtual machine (JVM) regardless of the
        underlying computer architecture. The syntax of Java is similar to C and C++, but has fewer<BR>
        low-level facilities than either of them. The Java runtime provides dynamic capabilities<BR>

        Java gained popularity shortly after its release, and has been a very popular programming<BR>
        language since then.[18] Java was the third most popular programming language in 2022 according to<BR>
